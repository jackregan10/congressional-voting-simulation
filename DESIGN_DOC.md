### Design Features
* Utility Functions (UtilityFunctions Class)
  * Helper class for the main routine. Also communicates with WriteFile when math is needed for output
    statements.


* File Reading and Data Configuration (ReadFile Class)
  * Reads input file with data pertaining to simulation.


* File Writing and Data Output (WriteFile Class)
  * Writes csv with output data.


* Simulation (Model Class)
  * Contains main routine of simulation. Takes in parameters representing Agents in a data structure that
    contains their individual parameters and a count variable describing the number of iterations to
    be run.


* Driver (Run Class)
  * Initializes all classes and translate information between file objects and model.
